#### 自我介绍

Hello, my name is Li Yue. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree at the School of Software Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and I am in my second year. I am expected to graduate in March 2025. I have earned my bachelor degree in Nanjing University, also at the School of Software Engineering, where I ranked in the top 6% of my class in terms of GPA. 

I have had two internship experiences, both in application development. My first internship was at Microsoft Suzhou Outlook, where I developed and deployed a web-based online drawing board (similar to a graphical online document), mainly responsible for the frontend. My second internship was at a surveying and mapping company with about thirty to forty employees, where I developed and deployed an Android application for project process advancement and tracking. 

Currently, I am studying at the Scalable and Computational Laboratory at Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Software School. I am involved in a project on a spiking neural network operating system, in collaboration with the Zhejiang Laboratory, where I am responsible for the hardware simulation.

I have experience working with programming languages like C++ and Golang, and I have also done a bit of Android development. My CET-6 score is 590.

#### OOP features

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and programs.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolves around four main features:

1. **Encapsulation**: Combining data and the methods that operate on that data into one unit, while keeping both safe from outside interference and misuse.
2. **Abstraction**: Focusing on the essential qualities of an object rather than its specific implementation, making complex systems easier to manage.
3. **Inheritance**: Allowing a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, promoting code reuse and organization.
4. **Polymorphism**: Letting one interface represent different types of actions, making it easier to expand and manage code.

#### GC

##### 概念

Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector attempts to reclaim  memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program.

##### 工作机制：识别+reclaim

1. **Identifying Garbage**: The garbage collector identifies which objects are no longer accessible by the application. If an object cannot be reached through a reference from any accessible variable or object, it's considered garbage.
2. **Reclaiming Memory**: Once the garbage objects are identified, the memory they occupy is reclaimed and made available for future allocations. This process can involve compacting the memory to reduce fragmentation.

##### 重要性

- **Memory Efficiency**: Garbage collection helps ensure that **a program doesn't run out of memory** by freeing up space that's no longer needed. This is crucial for long-running applications.
- **Safety**: By automatically managing memory, garbage collection helps **prevent memory leaks**—situations where unused memory is not returned to the pool of available memory, potentially exhausting system resources.
- **Simplicity**: Garbage collection **abstracts away the complexity of manual memory management**, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than the details of allocating and deallocating memory.

##### 技术

- **Mark and Sweep**: This algorithm marks reachable objects and then sweeps through the memory to collect unreached (garbage) objects.
- **Reference Counting**: Each object has a count of references to it. When the count reaches zero, the object is considered garbage and can be collected.
- **Generational GC**: Objects are categorized into generations based on their age. Younger objects are collected more frequently than older ones, based on the observation that most objects die young.

Java: generational GC + mark and sweep.

##### 限制

1.  it can introduce **unpredictability** in terms of when memory is reclaimed.
2. consume system resources.

#### Abstract class  & Interface

- **Implementation**: Interfaces are purely abstract and **cannot contain any implementation details** , while abstract classes can provide a **partial implementation**.
- **Inheritance**: A class can implement **multiple** interfaces, which allows for a form of multiple inheritance. In contrast, a class can extend only one abstract class.
- **Fields and Access Modifiers**: Abstract classes can have instance fields and can use any access modifier for methods and fields. Interfaces can only have public, static, and final fields, and all methods are public by default.

Choosing between an interface and an abstract class depends on the specific needs of your design. If you need to define a contract for a set of classes without enforcing a particular implementation, an interface is a suitable choice. If you need to share code among closely related classes, then an abstract class might be the better option.

#### IoC

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in software engineering that inverts the flow of control in a program. 

 IoC is used to manage dependencies and configuration, reducing the coupling between components. 

#### AOP

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. A cross-cutting concern is a concern that affects multiple parts of an application and cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system.

AOP works by adding additional behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code itself.

组合： They are complementary and often used together in modern software development to create systems that are more modular, easier to maintain, and adaptable to changes. Many frameworks, like Spring, provide support for both IoC and AOP, allowing developers to leverage the benefits of both paradigms.





#### ArrayList & LinkedList

**Internal Structure**: `ArrayList` uses a dynamic array to store its elements. This means that elements are placed in contiguous memory locations, allowing for quick and easy access by index.

`LinkedList` uses a doubly linked list to store its elements. Each element (node) in the list contains the data and references to both the next and the previous node, allowing for bidirectional traversal.

**difference**

`LinkedList` allows for **fast insertions and deletions** from any part of the list (constant time, O(1)), as it only requires updating the references of adjacent nodes. 

However, **accessing an element by its index is slower** (linear time, O(n)) because it requires traversing the list from the beginning or the end to locate the desired element.

ArratList is in the opposite way. 

#### final

**Variables**: When applied to a variable, `final` means that the variable can be assigned only once. Once a `final` variable has been assigned, it cannot be changed. 

**Methods**: When a method is declared `final`, it cannot be overridden by subclasses.

**Classes**: Declaring a class `final` prevents it from being subclassed. 

#### write-through and write back

In a write-through cache, every write operation to the cache also writes to the underlying storage **simultaneously**. This ensures that the cache and the storage are **always in sync**.

In a write-back (or write-behind) cache, write operations are initially written only to the cache. The data is marked as dirty, indicating that it has been changed but not yet written to the storage. The dirty data is written back to the underlying storage at a later time(usually when the data is swaped out to memory)

#### deadlock and starvation

Starvation happens when a process or thread is perpetually denied the resources it needs to complete its work. 

Deadlock is a specific condition where two or more processes are each waiting for another to release a resource, resulting in a cycle of dependencies that prevents any of them from proceeding.

死锁四条件：mutual exclusion (only one process can use a resource at a time), hold and wait (processes holding resources can request additional ones), no preemption (resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes), and circular wait (a circular chain of processes exists, where each process holds one or more resources needed by the next).

#### How to solve differences in cooperation

To resolve differences in cooperation effectively, it's important to follow these steps:

1. **Open Communication**: Foster an environment where everyone feels safe to express their views openly.
2. **Identify the Root Cause**: Understand the underlying issues causing the disagreement.
3. **Empathy and Respect**: Try to see the situation from others' perspectives and respect differing opinions.
4. **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Work together to brainstorm and agree on solutions that address everyone's needs.
